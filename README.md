The Odin Project learning trail, project calculator

Started this project by watching a tutorial and trying to understand what is going on.
A week later after watching the tutorial a few times and then starting to understand and writing it on my own, I have managed to redo the calculator by myself with no additional help.
Started by writing pseudocode for the calculator and then followed my own pseudocode to complete the calculaotr.

- Inside the prject there will be two JS files.
  ## calculator.js
  - Which will be the code that was refracted with help of GPT and the more fancy code, that also adds comma to thousends in the calculator
  ## calculator-redo.js
  - In this file I did again, and again, and again, and again the project, till I managed to do it by myself :)
